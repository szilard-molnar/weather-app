# Weather-app

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, API, AJAX

This application uses Open Weather Map API to render live weather information about any cities around the world. When the user types in the name of the city and clicks "Search", the app fetches information from the API and renders it on the screen. This information will be the current weather conditions, and a 5-days forecast.

The application saves the cities into the local storage, so upon opening the app again the previous searches will be rendered on the screen from the browser's local storage.

Hope you will enjoy!!!
