# Weather-app

This application uses Open Weather Map API to render live weather information about any cities around the world. The user needs to type in the city that he wants to get weather information about and the application pulls the current weather information and a 5 day weather forecast.

The application saves the cities into the local storage, so upon opening the app again the previous searches will be rendered on the screen from the browser's local storage.

Hope you will enjoy!!!
